# Content-Based-Movie-Reccommendation-system-Python-ML-Project
Developement of a Python-based machine learning model for a content and popularity-based movie recommendation system
•	Determined the essential feature columns names from the dataset for developing the recommendation system model
•	Utilized the sklearn library's TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction process converting textual data into feature vectors
•	Evaluated similarities by employing the cosine_similarity algorithm on feature vector and assigning similarity scores
•	Employed the difflib library to perform comparison between user input and the closest matching movie in the dataset
